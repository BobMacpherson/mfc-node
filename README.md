mfc-node
==========

mfc-node lets you follow and archive your favorite models' shows on myfreecams.com

This is an attempt to create a script similar to [capturbate-node](https://github.com/SN4T14/capturebate-node) based on different pieces of code found in the Internet.

Requirements
==========
(Debian 7, minimum)

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/) used to run mfc-node, hence the name. (Tested on `4.4.7` and `6.3.1`)

[ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

Setup
===========

Install requirements, run `npm install` in the same folder as main.js is.

Edit `config.yml` file and set desirable values for `captureDirectory`, `completeDirectory`, `modelScanInterval`.

Open `updates.yml` file and add names of your favorite models in `includeModels` or add  uids of your favorite models in `includeUids`:

```
includeModels: [aaaa, bbbb, cccc]
```
or
```
includeModels:
  - aaaa # two spaces + dash + space + model's name
  - bbbb
  - cccc
```
For more details please check YAML specification for [collections](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.html#collections).

Be mindful when capturing many streams at once to have plenty of space on disk and the bandwidth available or youâ€™ll end up dropping a lot of frames and the files will be useless.

> Note: You should edit `config.yml` file only when the script is not running, otherwise, there is a big chance that your changes will be lost.

> Note: It's not recommended to edit `models` section of `config.yml`. If you want to include, exclude or delete the model consider using `includeModels`, `excludeModels` and `deleteModels` sections or use web interface.

Running
===========

To start capturing streams you need to run `node main.js` I recommend you do this in [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) as that'll keep running if you lose connection to the machine or otherwise close your shell.

Control
===========
Open url `http://<ip of machine running script>:9080` in your browser. The list of online models will be displayed with a set of allowed commands for each model.

* __Include__ - if you want to record the model
* __Exclude__ - if you don't want to record the model anymore
* __Delete__ - if you are not interested in the model and wanna hide her permanently

> Note: This is not real-time application. Whenever your __include__, __exclude__ or __delete__ the model your changes will be applied only with the next iteration of `mainLoop` function of the script. `mainLoop` runs every `modelScanInterval` (default: 30sec).
> There is no __auto reload__ feature, you have to reload the list manually (__big red button__), however, keep in mind this list is updated internally every `modelScanInterval`.
